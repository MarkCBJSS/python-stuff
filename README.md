# About this Repo
In this Python Stuff repo you'll find, wait for it... Python stuff!

It's simply a collection of home brew Python scripts, patterns and examples, along with tutorials I've completed and/or tweaked.

## TokyoEdTech Tutorials
Christian Thompson (https://christianthompson.com ) creates tutorials for kids to learn Python, mostly with Turtle. Some are a few years old, but they're all good intros to Python programming.
- Calculator
- Maze Game
- Pong
- Snake
- Space War

I also added a *Game Coordinate Finder* utility as the co-ords for placing game items wasn't exactly 'obvious'.

## 5 Mini Projects
This set of examples comes from the website at:
https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/
- Dice Rolling Simulator
- Guess the Number
- Mad Libs Generator
- Hangman Game
- Text Based Adventure

## Oledium
This text based adventure game is one I keep remaking in various languages. Not intended as a complete game, the aim is to use all the elements of Python and get a better sense of how they might work together.
