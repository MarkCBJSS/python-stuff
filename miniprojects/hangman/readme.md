# Hangman

A text based version of the Hangman game.

This pulls in a list of words from words_file.py and shows the classic [ _ _ _ _ ] for the letters to be guessed.
The player can see letters guessed correctly, how many guesses they have left and the letters they've already tried.

I heavily refactored the set, variable and file names to make them more readable. See the original to get an idea of how the naming was confusing. 
Please avoid this in your own programs!
